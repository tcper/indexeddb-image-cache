2. Make sure to point to `dev` branch;
3. Mark your pull request as `DRAFT` until it will be ready to review;
4. Before marking a PR ready to review, make sure that:

    a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.
    
    b. `npm test` doesn't throw any error.
